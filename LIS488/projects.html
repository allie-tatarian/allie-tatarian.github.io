      <b>LIS488: Technology for Information Professionals, Fall 2018</b>
      <br>The main project in LIS488 was to build a personal website (the one you're reading now!). The website must include at least 5 pages, one CSS stylesheet, and, for extra credit, some Javascript code (found here in the "alt text" buttons under each picture.).
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      <b>LIS407: Information Sources and Services, Fall 2018</b>
      <br> I created a LibGuide (also known as a pathfinder) for my final project in LIS407. The pathfinder had to contain information about the demographic served, as well as 20-25 sources with descriptions and citations. I made a guide with LGBTQ resources for families in the New Bedford area, which can be found <a href="https://simmonslis.libguides.com/lgbtq-family-newbedford">here.</a>
